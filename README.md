TCGA data retrieval and analysis

## Data retrieval
Use manifest generated when downloading files from GDC (TCGA data portal) to extract case IDs. Case IDs are then used to look up UUIDs for corresponding gene expression annotation and slide image files and download files.  

Annotated somatic mutation file retrieval is still a work in progress.
